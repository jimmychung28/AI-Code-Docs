# API Documentation API Reference

This API is used to create a new item or to retrieve the details of an existing item using its ID.

## Base URL
`http://localhost:8000`

## Authentication
```bash
# Authentication using API key
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/endpoint" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Given the provided FastAPI code, the API does not include any authentication methods. Therefore, the following documentation assumes that an authentication method will be added, such as token-based authentication.

1. Authentication Methods Supported:
   - Token-based authentication: This API supports token-based authentication. 

2. How to Obtain API Keys/Tokens:
   - To obtain an API token, you would typically need to register or sign up with the service, log in, and request for a token. The details of this process would depend on the service provider. 

3. How to Include Authentication in Requests:
   - Once you have your token, you can include it in the headers of your HTTP requests. An `Authorization` key is typically used with the value set to `Bearer <Your-API-Token>`.

4. Security Best Practices:
   - Never share your API tokens with anyone.
   - Do not hard-code your tokens in your application code.
   - Use secure connections (HTTPS) to prevent tokens from being intercepted during transmission.
   - Regularly rotate and change your tokens.

5. Example Requests with Authentication:
   - Here is how you can include the token in a POST request to the "/items/" endpoint:

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://api.example.com/items/"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer Your-API-Token"}
data = json.dumps({"name": "Sample", "price": 99.9})

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)
```

   - And here is an example of a GET request to the "/items/{item_id}" endpoint:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/items/1"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer Your-API-Token"}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

Please note, the above is just a general guide. The actual implementation will depend on how the authentication is designed for this API.

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `400` | {'description': "This error is raised when the `item_id` is less than 0. The error message 'Invalid ID' is displayed.", 'handling': 'Validate `item_id` at the client side and ensure it is not less than 0 before making the request.', 'example_response': {'detail': 'Invalid ID'}} |
| `422` | {'description': 'This error is raised when the request is well-formed, however due to semantic errors it is unable to be processed. This usually happens when the client provides data in the wrong format or that does not conform to the defined model.', 'handling': 'Ensure that the data being sent in the request body is in the correct format and adheres to the defined `Item` model.', 'example_response': {'detail': [{'loc': ['body', 'price'], 'msg': 'field required', 'type': 'value_error.missing'}]}} |
